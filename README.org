#+TITLE: Project Notes for Research Internship in the Lab of Aurelien Tellier
#+SUBTITLE: Coevolution of human and malaria pathogen under supervision of Meline Saubin.
#+STARTUP: showstars

* Tasks
- [ ] Chr 11: Filter SNPs to vcf for further analysis
- [ ] Choose multiple populations for the analysis (Kenya and Gambia, but more?)
  - read more Malaria population genetics, additional populations. Vivax as well?
- [-] Calculate TajD
  - What region size around the locis?
  - Chr 11; Pfsa3
  - Use neutral poymorphisms.

* HbS-associated variants in /P. falciparum/
Described in Band et al are three loci /Pfsa1, 2/ and /3/3 (P.falciparum sickle-associated)

- Pfsa1: chr2: *631,190 T>A variant*, which lies in PfACS8, was associated with HbS
- Pfsa2: chr2: *814,288 C>T variant*, which lies in Pf3D7_0220300,
- Pfsa3: chr11: *1,058,035 T>A variant*, which lies in Pf3D7_1127000,

*Do these loci show signs of balancing selection indicating coevolution with the host?*

* Pf7 populations

* Data
