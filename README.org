* Tasks :noexport:
- [ ] DAPC and PCA_africa plot
  - Maybe with F_st population differentitaion between chooses populations
- [ ] Plot the unfolded SFS.
  - Polarize the vcf file. Then calculate the unfolded sfs.
  - chr11 and chr2. different types of sites. Sites far away from each other.
  - angsd -doSaf not really working.

* Unfolded sfs
- EasySFS: can calculate the unfolded SFS, but requires accurately polarized SFS (https://github.com/isaacovercast/easySFS)
- SuperSFS: can speculate the anchestral allele, but need the outgroup included in the vcf file (https://github.com/xhchauvet/superSFS)
- repolarize-vcf: can be used to repolarize a vcf file using the genotype of one sample (outgroup) in the vcf. (https://github.com/xuelingyi/repolarize-vcf/blob/main/README.md)

Divergence between falciparum and reichenowi? https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001099
Reichenowi has been used as an outgroup: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4316729/

* Questions
- What does plasmodiums parasitic lifestyle traits contribute it's transmission demography (ie. fluctuating population sizes or mulitple merger events) and adative processes (such as  positive selection and/or coevolution)?
- Can we compare /P.falciparum/ to /P.vivax/?
- Do things like recombination with multiple mergers affect selection and how?
- What about genetic burden, such as Muller's ratchet or clonal interference?
- What signatures do the /Pfsa/ loci show, when accounting for their demography? What about compared to genes under positive selection?

* Ideas for analysis
- PCA analysis to show the clustering of samples by location or year. Choose some good samples for further analysis. Should the SNPs be filtered for LD to remove correlations?
- Coalescent methods for demogaphic/multiple merger (MMC) methods [[cite:&korfmann-2023-simul-infer]]
- SMC? other coalescent methods. Quantifying recombination?
- Test for balancing selection?
- Time series of genomic data (ABS) (ask  Meline)

Think about the biological question we want to ask!!

* HbS-associated variants in /P. falciparum/
Described in Band et al are three loci /Pfsa1, 2/ and /3/3 (P.falciparum sickle-associated)

- Pfsa1: chr2: *631,190 T>A variant*, which lies in ACS8, was associated with HbS. PfACS8 (628,091-632,681)
- Pfsa2: chr2: *814,288 C>T variant*, which lies in Pf3D7_0220300,
- Pfsa3: chr11: *1,058,035 T>A variant*, which lies in Pf3D7_1127000,

*Do these loci show signs of balancing selection indicating coevolution with the host?* What could be the molecular mechanisms and virulence related functions?

* Population genetic stats
[[./output/Pf7.chr2.stats.DRC_GM_KE_MM.png]]

** Results
- D_{Taj} seems to be very low (< -2.5) for most regions of chr2 and chr11. Compare with P.vivax (-2) and P.falciparum antigenic genes (1.5-2). Can we confirm these values for chr2 (/Msp4/ , /Sera5/, /Sera8/)?

* PCA plot
#+attr_latex: :placement center :width 1.3\textwidth
[[./output/pca/Pf7.chr2.pca.all.png]]

* Tajima's D :noexport:
** Tajima's D
*** P.falciparum chr 2
[[./output/TajD/png/Pf7.chr2.full.TajD_DRC_GM_KE.png]]

** Tajima's D
*** P.falciparum chr 11
[[./output/TajD/png/Pf7.chr11.full.TajD_DRC_GM_KE.png]]

*  $\theta$ and $\pi$

* Discussion
** Tajima's D peaks?
How can we interpret the values of D_Taj?

- Nucelotide diversity:
- virtual absence of synonymous polymorphisms in genes not invovlved in disease or drug resistance ([[cite:&rich-2000-popul-struc]]).
  - What classifies these genes? Coevolutionary aspects? A high generation of sequence variants? By what mechanisms.

** Signatures of Balancing Selection?
Signatures of balancing selection:
- negative-frequency dependent selection

What is the gene ontology of genes under balancing selection? How can we show coevolution of these genes? What are some other methods for detecting balancing selection?
