#+TITLE: Project Notes for Research Internship in the Lab of Aurelien Tellier
#+SUBTITLE: Coevolution of human and malaria pathogen under supervision of Meline Saubin.
#+STARTUP: showstars

* Tasks
- [ ] Filter SNPs to vcf for further analysis
- [ ] Choose multiple populations for the analysis
- [X] set up R environment for conda and use with emacs
- [ ] Calculate TajD for regions and genome.

* HbS-associated variants in /P. falciparum/
Described in Band et al are three loci /Pfsa1, 2/ and /3/3 (P.falciparum sickle-associated)

- The chr2: *631,190 T>A variant*, which lies in PfACS8, was associated with HbS
- the chr2: *814,288 C>T variant*, which lies in Pf3D7_0220300,
- the chr11: *1,058,035 T>A variant*, which lies in Pf3D7_1127000,

*Do these loci show signs of balancing selection indicating coevolution with the host?*

* Code examples
** SNP filtering with bcf tools.
#+begin_src bash
bcftools view \
    --include 'FILTER="PASS" && N_ALT=1 && TYPE="snp" && QVSLOD>0.6 '\
    --output-type z\
    --output-file  Pf3D7_02_v3.SNP.vcf \
    Pf3D7_02_v3.pf7.vcf.gz

bcftools index -t Pf3D7_02_v3.SNP.vcf
