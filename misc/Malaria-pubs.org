#+title: Malaria Pubs

Hi Aurelien,

the Malaria Consortium provides a list with papers. Which can be found at:
https://www.malariagen.net/publications

Regarding the Tajimas D at least what I found for the vector are negative values:

I didn't check all the papers from the website but some still have some Tajimas D estimates, e.g. for antigen regions:
https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009801

or some other genes (here very negative):

Otherwise, they seem to describe more population differentiation stats in their overview papers:
