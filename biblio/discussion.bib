  abstract        = {Plasmodium falciparum is the agent of malignant malaria,
                  one of mankind's most severe maladies. The parasite exhibits
                  antigenic polymorphisms that have been postulated to be
                  ancient. We have proposed that the extant world populations of
                  P. falciparum have derived from one single parasite, a
                  cenancestor, within the last 5,000-50,000 years. This
                  inference derives from the virtual or complete absence of
                  synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms at genes not involved in
                  immune or drug responses. Seeking to conciliate this claim
                  with extensive antigenic polymorphism, we first note that
                  allele substitutions or polymorphisms can arise very rapidly,
                  even in a single generation, in large populations subject to
                  strong natural selection. Second, new alleles can arise not
                  only by single-nucleotide mutations, but also by
                  duplication/deletion of short simple-repeat DNA sequences, a
                  process several orders of magnitude faster than
                  single-nucleotide mutation. We analyze three antigenic genes
                  known to be extremely polymorphic: Csp, Msp-1, and Msp-2. We
                  identify regions consisting of tandem or proximally repetitive
                  short DNA sequences, including some previously unnoticed. We
                  conclude that the antigenic polymorphisms are consistent with
                  the recent origin of the world populations of P. falciparum
                  inferred from the analysis of nonantigenic genes.},
