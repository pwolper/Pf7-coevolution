  abstract        = {Plasmodium falciparum is the agent of malignant malaria,
                  one of mankind's most severe maladies. The parasite exhibits
                  antigenic polymorphisms that have been postulated to be
                  ancient. We have proposed that the extant world populations of
                  P. falciparum have derived from one single parasite, a
                  cenancestor, within the last 5,000-50,000 years. This
                  inference derives from the virtual or complete absence of
                  synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms at genes not involved in
                  immune or drug responses. Seeking to conciliate this claim
                  with extensive antigenic polymorphism, we first note that
                  allele substitutions or polymorphisms can arise very rapidly,
                  even in a single generation, in large populations subject to
                  strong natural selection. Second, new alleles can arise not
                  only by single-nucleotide mutations, but also by
                  duplication/deletion of short simple-repeat DNA sequences, a
                  process several orders of magnitude faster than
                  single-nucleotide mutation. We analyze three antigenic genes
                  known to be extremely polymorphic: Csp, Msp-1, and Msp-2. We
                  identify regions consisting of tandem or proximally repetitive
                  short DNA sequences, including some previously unnoticed. We
                  conclude that the antigenic polymorphisms are consistent with
                  the recent origin of the world populations of P. falciparum
                  inferred from the analysis of nonantigenic genes.},

  abstract        = {Understanding the influences of population structure,
                  selection, and recombination on polymorphism and linkage
                  disequilibrium (LD) is integral to mapping genes contributing
                  to drug resistance or virulence in Plasmodium falciparum. The
                  parasite's short generation time, coupled with a high
                  cross-over rate, can cause rapid LD break-down. However,
                  observations of low genetic variation have led to suggestions
                  of effective clonality: selfing, population admixture, and
                  selection may preserve LD in populations. Indeed, extensive LD
                  surrounding drug-resistant genes has been observed, indicating
                  that recombination and selection play important roles in
                  shaping recent parasite genome evolution. These studies,
                  however, provide only limited information about haplotype
                  variation at local scales. Here we describe the first (to our
                  knowledge) chromosome-wide SNP haplotype and population
                  recombination maps for a global collection of malaria
                  parasites, including the 3D7 isolate, whose genome has been
                  sequenced previously. The parasites are clustered according to
                  continental origin, but alternative groupings were obtained
                  using SNPs at 37 putative transporter genes that are
                  potentially under selection. Geographic isolation and highly
                  variable multiple infection rates are the major factors
                  affecting haplotype structure. Variation in effective
                  recombination rates is high, both among populations and along
                  the chromosome, with recombination hotspots conserved among
                  populations at chromosome ends. This study supports the
                  feasibility of genome-wide association studies in some
                  parasite populations.},
