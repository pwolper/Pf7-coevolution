  abstract =     {Plasmodium falciparum is the agent of malignant malaria, one
                  of mankind's most severe maladies. The parasite exhibits
                  antigenic polymorphisms that have been postulated to be
                  ancient. We have proposed that the extant world populations of
                  P. falciparum have derived from one single parasite, a
                  cenancestor, within the last 5,000-50,000 years. This
                  inference derives from the virtual or complete absence of
                  synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms at genes not involved in
                  immune or drug responses. Seeking to conciliate this claim
                  with extensive antigenic polymorphism, we first note that
                  allele substitutions or polymorphisms can arise very rapidly,
                  even in a single generation, in large populations subject to
                  strong natural selection. Second, new alleles can arise not
                  only by single-nucleotide mutations, but also by
                  duplication/deletion of short simple-repeat DNA sequences, a
                  process several orders of magnitude faster than
                  single-nucleotide mutation. We analyze three antigenic genes
                  known to be extremely polymorphic: Csp, Msp-1, and Msp-2. We
                  identify regions consisting of tandem or proximally repetitive
                  short DNA sequences, including some previously unnoticed. We
                  conclude that the antigenic polymorphisms are consistent with
                  the recent origin of the world populations of P. falciparum
                  inferred from the analysis of nonantigenic genes.},

  abstract =     {Abstract Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites
                  is a ubiquitous process in nature. The theory of coevolution
                  describes how reciprocal changes in genotype frequencies occur
                  in the interacting species over time. Host-parasite
                  coevolution is driven by two types of frequency-dependent
                  selection (FDS): indirect FDS arises from the host-parasite
                  interaction, while direct FDS arises from ecological features
                  which affect coevolution. Depending on the balance between
                  indirect and direct FDS and the strength of stochastic
                  processes in natural populations coevolution, two main
                  outcomes occur: trench warfare dynamics as the long-term
                  maintenance of genetic and phenotypic diversity and an arms
                  race with ultimate fixation of genotypes in both species.
                  Coevolution is a prime example of eco-evo processes in which
                  there is feedback between short-term ecological dynamics and
                  the evolutionary dynamics of allele frequencies. With new
                  sequencing technologies, it is possible to reveal how
                  coevolution shapes the genomic diversity and genome evolution
                  of antagonistic species. Hosts can vary in the specificity of
                  their resistance to parasites, and parasites can vary in the
                  corresponding infectivity. The specificity of the
                  host-parasite interaction is governed by genes which coevolve.
                  Hosts can further vary in their quantitative resistance and
                  parasite in their virulence. These traits and the underlying
                  genotypes change frequency in time due to indirect and direct
                  frequency-dependent selection (FDS). Indirect FDS arises from
                  the host-parasite interaction, while direct FDS arises from
                  ecological features which affect coevolution. The balance
                  between these two types of FDS determines the stability of the
                  polymorphism of the coevolving genotypes. The further role of
                  stochastic processes, such as genetic drift, is to generate
                  either arms race or trench warfare dynamics of gene
                  frequencies. The costs of resistance and infectivity are
                  necessary to generate coevolutionary cycles in time but not
                  sufficient to promote stable long-term polymorphism.
                  Ecological-evolutionary (eco-evo) feedbacks and trade-offs due
                  to fitness costs can explain the dynamics of coevolution and
                  the stability of coevolutionary outcomes. The genomes of
                  antagonistic species can be partitioned into major, minor and
                  neutral genes which present different signatures of genetic
                  diversity and can be used to study coevolution based on the
                  theoretical framework described here.},
