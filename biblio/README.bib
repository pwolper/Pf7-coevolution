  abstract =     {The reproductive mechanism of a species is a key driver of
                  genome evolution. The standard Wright-Fisher model for the
                  reproduction of individuals in a population assumes that each
                  individual produces a number of offspring negligible compared
                  to the total population size. Yet many species of plants,
                  invertebrates, prokaryotes or fish exhibit neutrally skewed
                  offspring distribution or strong selection events yielding few
                  individuals to produce a number of offspring of up to the same
                  magnitude as the population size. As a result, the genealogy
                  of a sample is characterized by multiple individuals (more
                  than two) coalescing simultaneously to the same common
                  ancestor. The current methods developed to detect such
                  multiple merger events do not account for complex demographic
                  scenarios or recombination, and require large sample sizes. We
                  tackle these limitations by developing two novel and different
                  approaches to infer multiple merger events from sequence data
                  or the ancestral recombination graph (ARG): a sequentially
                  Markovian coalescent (SM$\beta$C) and a graph neural network
                  (GNNcoal). We first give proof of the accuracy of our methods
                  to estimate the multiple merger parameter and past demographic
                  history using simulated data under the $\beta$-coalescent
                  model. Secondly, we show that our approaches can also recover
                  the effect of positive selective sweeps along the genome.
                  Finally, we are able to distinguish skewed offspring
                  distribution from selection while simultaneously inferring the
                  past variation of population size. Our findings stress the
                  aptitude of neural networks to leverage information from the
                  ARG for inference but also the urgent need for more accurate
                  ARG inference approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe

                  of mankind's most severe maladies. The parasite exhibits
                  antigenic polymorphisms that have been postulated to be
                  ancient. We have proposed that the extant world populations of
                  P. falciparum have derived from one single parasite, a
                  cenancestor, within the last 5,000-50,000 years. This
                  inference derives from the virtual or complete absence of
                  synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms at genes not involved in
                  immune or drug responses. Seeking to conciliate this claim
                  with extensive antigenic polymorphism, we first note that
                  allele substitutions or polymorphisms can arise very rapidly,
                  even in a single generation, in large populations subject to
                  strong natural selection. Second, new alleles can arise not
                  only by single-nucleotide mutations, but also by
                  duplication/deletion of short simple-repeat DNA sequences, a
                  process several orders of magnitude faster than
                  single-nucleotide mutation. We analyze three antigenic genes
                  known to be extremely polymorphic: Csp, Msp-1, and Msp-2. We
                  identify regions consisting of tandem or proximally repetitive
                  short DNA sequences, including some previously unnoticed. We
                  conclude that the antigenic polymorphisms are consistent with
                  the recent origin of the world populations of P. falciparum
                  inferred from the analysis of nonantigenic genes.},

  abstract =     {Abstract Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites
                  is a ubiquitous process in nature. The theory of coevolution
                  describes how reciprocal changes in genotype frequencies occur
                  in the interacting species over time. Host-parasite
                  coevolution is driven by two types of frequency-dependent
                  selection (FDS): indirect FDS arises from the host-parasite
                  interaction, while direct FDS arises from ecological features
                  which affect coevolution. Depending on the balance between
                  indirect and direct FDS and the strength of stochastic
                  processes in natural populations coevolution, two main
                  outcomes occur: trench warfare dynamics as the long-term
                  maintenance of genetic and phenotypic diversity and an arms
                  race with ultimate fixation of genotypes in both species.
                  Coevolution is a prime example of eco-evo processes in which
                  there is feedback between short-term ecological dynamics and
                  the evolutionary dynamics of allele frequencies. With new
                  sequencing technologies, it is possible to reveal how
                  coevolution shapes the genomic diversity and genome evolution
                  of antagonistic species. Hosts can vary in the specificity of
                  their resistance to parasites, and parasites can vary in the
                  corresponding infectivity. The specificity of the
                  host-parasite interaction is governed by genes which coevolve.
                  Hosts can further vary in their quantitative resistance and
                  parasite in their virulence. These traits and the underlying
                  genotypes change frequency in time due to indirect and direct
                  frequency-dependent selection (FDS). Indirect FDS arises from
                  the host-parasite interaction, while direct FDS arises from
                  ecological features which affect coevolution. The balance
                  between these two types of FDS determines the stability of the
                  polymorphism of the coevolving genotypes. The further role of
                  stochastic processes, such as genetic drift, is to generate
                  either arms race or trench warfare dynamics of gene
                  frequencies. The costs of resistance and infectivity are
                  necessary to generate coevolutionary cycles in time but not
                  sufficient to promote stable long-term polymorphism.
                  Ecological-evolutionary (eco-evo) feedbacks and trade-offs due
                  to fitness costs can explain the dynamics of coevolution and
                  the stability of coevolutionary outcomes. The genomes of
                  antagonistic species can be partitioned into major, minor and
                  neutral genes which present different signatures of genetic
                  diversity and can be used to study coevolution based on the
                  theoretical framework described here.},
