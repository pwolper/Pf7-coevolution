  abstract        = {Understanding the influences of population structure,
                  selection, and recombination on polymorphism and linkage
                  disequilibrium (LD) is integral to mapping genes contributing
                  to drug resistance or virulence in Plasmodium falciparum. The
                  parasite's short generation time, coupled with a high
                  cross-over rate, can cause rapid LD break-down. However,
                  observations of low genetic variation have led to suggestions
                  of effective clonality: selfing, population admixture, and
                  selection may preserve LD in populations. Indeed, extensive LD
                  surrounding drug-resistant genes has been observed, indicating
                  that recombination and selection play important roles in
                  shaping recent parasite genome evolution. These studies,
                  however, provide only limited information about haplotype
                  variation at local scales. Here we describe the first (to our
                  knowledge) chromosome-wide SNP haplotype and population
                  recombination maps for a global collection of malaria
                  parasites, including the 3D7 isolate, whose genome has been
                  sequenced previously. The parasites are clustered according to
                  continental origin, but alternative groupings were obtained
                  using SNPs at 37 putative transporter genes that are
                  potentially under selection. Geographic isolation and highly
                  variable multiple infection rates are the major factors
                  affecting haplotype structure. Variation in effective
                  recombination rates is high, both among populations and along
                  the chromosome, with recombination hotspots conserved among
                  populations at chromosome ends. This study supports the
                  feasibility of genome-wide association studies in some
                  parasite populations.},
