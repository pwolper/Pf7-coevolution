#+title: Discussion

* Malaria specific discussion
- Implications of these results for the study of genetic variation in malaria?
- Importance of accounting for demography for selection inference and life-history traits.
- What can we say about effective control measures.
* Discussion of the population structure results
* Discussion of the U-shaped SFS
- gene flow can lead to u-shaped SFS without invoking any directional selection.
- sweepstake reproduction
- misorientation of anchestral and derived alleles.
- biased gene conversion (relevant in Plasmodium, considering extremely high AT content?)
- directional selection at multiple loci as a cause of u-shaped SFS. And background selection?
- temporally variable selection (makes sense for a pathogen)
- reproductive strategies (i.e. sweepstakes reproduction) and multiple merger events.
* Maybe discussion of MMC models as a more appropriate null model
