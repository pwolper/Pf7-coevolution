#$-cwd 
# This option tells gridware to change to the current directory before executing the job
# (default is the home of the user).

#$-pe serial 1
# Specify this option only for multithreaded jobs that use more than one cpu core.
# IMPORTANT! Don't use more than 4 cores to keep free space for other students!

#$-l vf=1g
# This option declares the amount of memory the job will use. Specify this value as accurate as possible.
# IMPORTANT! memory request is multiplied by the number of requested CPU cores specified with the -pe.
# Thus, you should divide the overall memory consumption of your job by the number of parallel threads.
